# Tech challenge: Cobify

Rik Peters, January 2023. 


## Introduction

The basic problem is this: is there a difference in a car's performance when it runs on SP98 as opposed to E10? 


### Table of contents

In the Jupyter notebook in this repository, you can find the steps of cleaning, exploring, and building models. 
The folder 'data' contains the raw data (in csv and excel formats)


### Conclusions

The conclusions are the following: 

- There is a **low correlation** between fuel type and performance. 
- Accordingly, the lower price makes **E10 more attractive**. 
- However, more research is needed into the impact of fuel choice on a car's **life expectancy and maintenance costs**.
